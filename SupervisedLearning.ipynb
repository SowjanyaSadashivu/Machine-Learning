    "#### Supervised Learning\n",
    "- Supervised Learning is used whenever we want to predict the output from a given input, and we have examples of input/output pairs.\n",
    "- Two major types of supervised learning are Classification and Regression.\n",
    "- Classification : binary classification, multiclass classification.\n",
    "- binary classification : yes/no, 0/1, true/false, positive/negative kinda of outputs.\n",
    "- multiple classification : identifying the output among multiple classes.\n",
    "- regression : predict continuous no. \n",
    "- if there is a continuity in the output it is regression.\n",
    "- classigication output is not continuous. it is this or that."
